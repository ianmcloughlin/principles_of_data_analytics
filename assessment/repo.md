# Create Your GitHub Repository

For the assessment, you must submit a GitHub repository containing your work.  
You can do this by completing the following steps.  
They can all be performed using only your web browser.  
All you need to do then is work on your repository as described in the lectures.  

## Step 1: Set Up a GitHub Account

1. If you don’t already have a GitHub account, go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign up:
   - Click the `Sign up` button in the top-right corner.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to create your account.
   - Choose a professional username that you would feel comfortable including on your CV.  
2. Once your account is created, take a few minutes to explore the GitHub interface.

## Step 2: Create a New Repository

1. Open the repository creation page by visiting [github.com/new](https://github.com/new).  
   Alternatively, on [GitHub](https://github.com), click the `+` icon near the top-right corner and select `New repository`.

2. Repository details:
   - `Repository name`: Use a meaningful name (e.g., the module name).  
     Ensure the name contains only lowercase letters, underscores, or hyphens (no spaces).  

   - `Visibility`: I recommend leaving the repository as `Public`.  
     If you choose `Private`, you must [add `ianmcloughlin` as a collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository).

   - Tick the box for `Add a README file`.

   - From the `Add .gitignore` dropdown, select `Python`.

   - Leave the `License` option as `None`, unless you want to add one.

3. Click `Create repository` to finish.  
   You will be redirected to your new repository page.

## Step 3: Submit Your Repository URL

1. Copy the URL of your repository from your browser’s address bar.  
   It should look like this: `https://github.com/username/reponame`.

2. Paste this URL into the submission form linked in the [assessment instructions](instructions.md).  
   You must be logged into your ATU account to access the form.
