# Assessment

These are the assessment instructions for Principles of Data Analytics in 2024/2025.  
You will complete tasks in a Jupyter notebook and submit it as part of a GitHub repository.  

The assessment allows you to demonstrate your achievement of the module learning outcomes.  
Start early and work consistently.  
If you have questions, ask them well before the deadline.  

## Submit

**[Click here to submit your repository URL](https://forms.office.com/e/hjfv791PQ2)**  

Repository URL Submission Deadline: **Friday, 31 January 2025**.  
Final Deadline for all Assessment Elements: **Sunday, 04 May 2025**.  

Your last commit made **on or before the final deadline** will be graded.  

## Feedback

You are expected to work on your submission throughout the semester.  
Guidance on your expected progress will be provided in lectures.  

Submitted repositories will be reviewed during the semester.  
Personalized feedback will be given mid-semester.  
You must have submitted your repository URL to receive this feedback.  
Make sure to regularly push your work to GitHub.  

## Repository

Start by completing the steps in [repo.md](repo.md).  
Ensure your final submission is in the `main` branch.  

Your repository should contain only assessment-related files.  
You should work on your repository weekly throughout the semester.  
By the end, your commit history should be extensive.  

If you encounter issues with git, seek help well before the deadline.  
Do not delete any files or commits without first consulting the lecturer.  

Very large commits, especially late in the semester, will not be accepted.  
At any stage you may be asked to discuss your repository.  

### Organize Your Repository

Your work should be easy to showcase during a technical interview.  
An interviewer should be able to understand your work without any assistance.  
This will be a determining factor in assigning your mark.  

Make sure your repository is well-structured and includes:

- A clear [README.md](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes).
- A relevant [`.gitignore` file](https://github.com/github/gitignore).
- [No unnecessary files or folders](https://realpython.com/python-git-github-intro/#what-not-to-add-to-a-git-repo).
- Lowercase file and folder names, except for files like `README.md`.
- No spaces or special characters in filenames. Underscores, hyphens, and full stops are okay.

## Tasks

Complete all tasks outlined in **[tasks.md](tasks.md)**.  
All solutions must be in a notebook named `tasks.ipynb` in the root of your repository.  
Use Markdown headings to clearly identify each task within the notebook.  

### Packages and Libraries

You can use [modules in the standard library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_library) and any of the following libraries:  
`numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `pandas`, `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`.  
Ask before using anything else.  

### Writing Your Notebook

Break up your code into smaller, manageable cells whenever possible.  
Each code cell should focus on a single step in your overall solution.  
Use Markdown cells to give explanations and insights into your code.  

Include comments in all code cells to tell the reader what each statement does.  
Write clean, readable, and efficient code.  
Use meaningful variable names and consistent formatting.  
You should follow Python coding standards and guidelines such as [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).  

### Commits

Make regular commits to your repository.  
Your commit history should demonstrate how your solution to each task evolved.  
There should be evidence of incremental improvements, clarifications, and revisions.  

## Marking Scheme

Your submission will be graded based on the following five categories.  
Each category carries equal weight.  

Remember, we can only evaluate what is in your repository.  
It should contain evidence of achievement of the criteria below.  
The examiners' overall impression may affect marks in each category.  

### Presentation

- Well-organized and clean repository structure.  
- Clear narrative in notebooks.  
- Repository contents and purpose are easy to understand.  

### Research

- Evidence of research on relevant topics.
- Building upon the literature and documentation.
- Appropriate referencing and comparisons to similar work.

### Documentation

- Clear and concise explanations of concepts.  
- Informative comments in code.  
- Inclusion of standard repository files.  

### Development

- Correct, efficient, and clean code.  
- Use of standard programming structures, algorithms, and tests.  
- Clean architecture.

### Consistency

- A detailed commit history with many incremental changes.  
- Steady work on tasks throughout the semester.  
- Evidence of review and refinement in the repository.
