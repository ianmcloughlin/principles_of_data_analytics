# Frequently Asked Questions

This page answers common questions from students.
If you want to add a question, please email me.

## Can my GitHub repository be private?

Yes, it can be private.
However, you must add `ianmcloughlin` [as a collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository#inviting-a-collaborator-to-a-personal-repository).

## How should I include references in my submission?

In Jupyter notebooks, references should be included as hyperlinks, similar to a web page.
Unlike in word documents, PDFs, or books, references do not need to be listed at the end.
They should be placed where they are used, with context provided as to what they are and why they are relevant.
The key is to keep them clear and easy to read.

For example, in a Markdown cell:

```markdown
The `numpy.array` function ([see official documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array.html)) creates an array from a list or other data structure.
```

And in a code cell:

```python
# Create arrays from lists or other data structures.
# See: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array.html
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
```

There is no point in listing URLs at the end of a document without explaining their relevance to the submission.

## Can I change my GitHub username?

Your GitHub username is visible to potential employers, so choose carefully.
Using your real name is fine, but a reasonable pseudonym works too.
I would avoid using your student number as you might want to continue to use your account after you graduate.

To change your username, follow [GitHub's instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-user-account-settings/changing-your-github-username).

## How can I avoid plagiarism?

Follow ATU's [policies on plagiarism](https://studenthub.atu.ie) and the Student Code.
If you are unsure about anything, ask your lecturer.
Always give credit for ideas, text, or code that are not your own.
Use citations or comments to show sources.

## How can I get started when I feel uncertain of what to do?

This assessment is designed to develop your ability to think and work independently.
Feel unsure initially is normal.
Start by deciding:  

1. How to approach the task.  
2. What content to include.  
3. How to make the work unique to you.  

Employers value initiative, independence, and decision-making skills.
Show these by planning your work, managing your time, and using online resources for research.

## Can I check if the assessment instructions were updated during the semester?

You can view the change history of any file, including the assessment instructions, by clicking the "History" button near the top right of its page on [github.com](github.com).
The assessment instructions typically remain unchanged once released.
Sometimes there are minor edits for clarity or to fix typos, which should not affect the substance of the instructions.
Any major changes will be highlighted in lectures.

## How can I collaborate with other students?

For online or blended courses, the VLE page is the best place to discuss topics with others in your class.
We typically provide a student discussion forum there where students can ask and answer questions.
For in-house courses, the best way to collaborate is in the classroom.

Students sometimes set up groups on external platforms which are not managed by ATU.
While lecturers do not typically join, they can be useful for collaboration.
Remember to be polite and considerate, as tone is hard to convey in text communications.
Note that online content is difficult to remove and ATU policies may still apply when using external platforms.

## Can I use Generative AI in my Submission?

The following only applies to this module.
Make sure you clarify the situation for any other module you take.

Generative AI is everywhere, including development environments, operating systems, and search engines.
It would be impossible enforce any stipulation that it cannot be used here.
Instead, we designed the assessment to avoid easy completion via AI.

You may use AI for your submission, but it likely won't meet assessment the criteria.
You need to carefully check any information or code it generates, and always reference any AI platform you use.
Most platforms offer some form of shareable links to your past conversations that can be used as references.

## Can I include rough work in my repository?

Though not necessary, you can keep your own rough work in your repository.
This might include notes, experimental code, or copies of notebooks used in lectures or labs.
Please store these files in a folder named `roughwork` at the root of your repository.  
Keep the contents of the `roughwork` folder well organized, following the usual conventions for filenames and the like.

Please note that the contents of the `roughwork` folder will be ignored.
It will not be considered part of your submission and will not be used to determine your grade.
Anything that is part of your assessment submission must appear elsewhere in your repository.

## How can I get further help?

If you have questions, ask them well in advance of the deadline.
You can email you lecturers to ask for help.
However, we expect you attempted the problem yourself first.
You need to have something to show for your attempts.
We can give you guidance on your attempts, but we can't solve the problem for you.

Pay close attention to the marking scheme and advice in this FAQ.
They are based on feedback given to previous students in this and other modules.
You should treat them as a form of [feed-forward](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02602938.2022.2073434).
