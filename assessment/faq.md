# Frequently Asked Questions

This page answers common questions from students.  
If you think another question should be included, please email me.  

## Can my GitHub repository be private?

You can make your repository private.  
If you make it private, you must add `ianmcloughlin` [as a collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository#inviting-a-collaborator-to-a-personal-repository).  

## How should I include references in my submission?

You can include references in various ways in Jupyter notebooks.  
The key is to keep them clear and easy to read.  
Unlike books, where references are at the end, I recommend placing references close to where they are used.  

For example, in a Markdown cell:  

```markdown
The `numpy.array` function ([see official documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array.html)) creates an array from a list or other data structure.
```

And in a code cell:  

```python
# Create arrays from lists or other data structures.
# Documentation: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array.html
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
```

## How can I change my GitHub username?

Your GitHub username is visible to potential employers, so choose carefully.  
Using your real name is fine, but a reasonable pseudonym works too. Avoid using your student number.  

To change your username, follow [GitHub's instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-user-account-settings/changing-your-github-username).  

## How can I avoid plagiarism?

Follow ATU's [policies on plagiarism](https://studenthub.atu.ie) and the Student Code.  
If you are unsure about anything, ask your lecturer.  

Always give credit for ideas, text, or code that are not your own.  
Use citations or comments to show sources.  

## How can I get started when I feel uncertain of what to do?

This assessment is designed to develop your ability to think and work independently.  
Itâ€™s normal to feel unsure about how to start or what to include.  

Begin by deciding:  

1. How to approach the task.  
2. What content to include.  
3. How to make the work unique to you.  

Employers value initiative, independence, and decision-making skills.  
Show these by planning your work, managing your time, and using online resources for research.  

## How can I get help?

If you have questions, ask them well in advance of the deadline.  

You can always email you lecturers to ask for help.  
However, we expect you attempted the problem yourself first.  
You need to have something to show for your attempts.  
We can give you guidance on your attempts, but we can't solve the problem for you.

Pay close attention to the marking scheme and advice in this FAQ.
